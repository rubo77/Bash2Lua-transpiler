# Bash2Lua-transpiler

Transpile Bash and Shell scripts into Lua sourcecode.

This is mainly used to translate scripts in packages that are developed for gluon
but you can easily adapt it to your code style.

The script is far from perfect! It should just take away some initial global
regular expression replacement to start converting your script. A lot of work
still has to follow to make the Lua script run.
